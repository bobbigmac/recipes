# Onion Butty

## Ingredients
- 1/2 large white onion, sliced
- Plenty of salt
- Plenty of black pepper
- 2 slices of bread
- Garlic mayo

## Instructions
1. Slice the onion thinly and put it in a bowl.
2. Add plenty of salt and pepper, then mix well.
3. Let it sit for a few minutes so the salt draws out some moisture.
4. Spread garlic mayo on both slices of bread.
5. Pile the seasoned onions between the bread slices, grate a little extra mature cheddar if desired.
6. Enjoy. Better than beating them away with a stick.
