# Gluten-Free Pizza Dough

## Ingredients
- 1 cup Greek yoghurt (full-fat preferred)
- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking powder (optional, for extra lift)

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, combine yoghurt and gluten-free flour blend. Add a little extra flour until your dough is just about dry to touch.
2. Mix well with a wooden spoon or your hands until a dough forms.
3. Do not overwork the dough - just combine until no dry flour remains.
4. Cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. Roll out on a lightly floured surface (use more GF flour or cornmeal for dusting).
8. Add toppings and bake at 220°C (425°F) for 12-15 minutes until golden.
