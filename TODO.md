# TODO

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues

### Build System
- âœ… **Fixed Build Script**: Template literal syntax error in `scripts/build.js` line 25
  - Issue: Invalid escape sequences in template literals
  - Status: **RESOLVED** - Build now works correctly

## ðŸ”§ Immediate Fixes Needed

### Recipe Content
- **Fix Recipe Parser**: Recipes have inconsistent markdown indentation, allow that, so our recipes don't have to be strict.
  - `banana-bread.md`: Ingredients and instructions are over-indented
  - `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`: Similar indentation issues
  - `classic-pancakes.md`: Instructions formatting
  - `spaghetti-bolognese.md`: Content structure
  - `tomato-soup.md`: Formatting inconsistencies

### Frontend Functionality
- **Add Loading States**: Show loading indicators when fetching recipes

## ðŸš€ Enhancement Opportunities

### Recipe Management
- **Recipe Metadata**: Add cooking time, difficulty, servings

- **Recipe Categories**: Better tag organization and filtering
- **Recipe Search**: Full-text search across ingredients and instructions
- **Recipe Ratings**: User ratings and reviews system

### User Experience
- **Print Styles**: CSS for recipe printing
- **Recipe Scaling**: Adjust ingredient quantities **GOOD**
- **Unit Conversion**: Metric/imperial toggle
- **Recipe Sharing**: Social media sharing buttons

### Technical Improvements

- **Open Graph**: Social media preview tags

### Content Expansion
